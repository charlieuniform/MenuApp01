# MenuApp01
A simple HTML static menu board application for digital screens. Great for use with charlieuniform (coming soon, currently in Beta.)

It shows menu item images ontop of a background image with menu items and prices. It is a first pass and is relatively repsonsive.

This app is rudimentary, but serves as a demonstration of a most basic HTML web application for display on a screen via a browser in full-screen mode.

## CharlieUniform
